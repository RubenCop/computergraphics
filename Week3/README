You will find 2 folders with code:
	-the cube model
	-the sphere model with phong shading

We experienced some difficulties during this assignment. The biggest of them was getting the phong shading right. In the end we did not manage to get 
the specular lighting right. We now have spheres for which the specurar spot is at the back of the sphere. But we didn't manage to get these spots in the
right place. 


EXTRA/BONUS
We have written 2 extra's (both only possible in the code for the spheres):
	-It is possible to move the camera with the following keys:
		- x-coordinates:
			-'q' to go in negative direction
			-'w' to go in positive direction 
		- y-coordinates:
			-'a' to go in negative direction
			-'s' to go in positive direction 
		- z-coordinates:
			-'z' to go in negative direction
			-'x' to go in positive direction 
	
	-Reset buttons for: 
		-Rotation
		-Scaling
		-Camera position
	These buttons may be handy if you have turned, scaled or rotated the model and you want to go back to the initial position.

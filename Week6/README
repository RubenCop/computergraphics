We have implemented the reading of a texture by adding an Image variable to the
material. This is a null pointer by default, and will be changed to an image
that is specified in the yams file. By checking if this pointer is null, we also
check if there is a texture at all, or if the normal colour calculation should
be used.

We implemented the rotation of the texture using Rodriguesâ€™ Rotation Formula
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodrigues%27_rotation_formula). An example of a
rotated earth can be found in the screenshots.

We have implemented Gooch shading, with specular calculation but not shadows or
reflections. An example can be found in the screenshots.

The objects that can be rendered by our raytracer are the following:
- Sphere
- Triangle
- Plane
- Cylinder
- Quad

We use the provided glm file to read obj files. We have adapted the yaml parsing
part of the program such that obj files can be defined in the yaml file. This
can be done by providing a filename, a position and a material. An example of
this can be found in the file "scenefiles/gary.yaml". The provided screenshot
shows Gary rendered from an obj file.

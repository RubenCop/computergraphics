For the different render modes, we have added a string to the Scene class that
stores the render mode described in the yaml file. We have added to new trace
functions to the scene class:
	- trace (phong)
	- traceZ (z-buffer)
	- traceNormal (normal)
We have adjusted the function "render" to choose one of the trace functions
based on the render mode save in the string. We have also adjusted this function
so that it scales the colours in case of the z-buffer image. In the traceZ
function, we divide the calculated colours by 1000 so that they become a small
number that can be scaled later.

We have added three new objects to the raytracer: a plane and a triangle.
	- Plane: a plane is defined by a normal (normal)
	- Triangle: a triangle is defined by three triples (a,b,c) that define the
	  points of the triangle. The intersection of the ray and triangle is
	  calculated using the MÃ¶ller-Trumbore algorithm.
	- Cylinder: a cylinder is defined by two points, one for each end, and a
      radius. However, it is infinitely long.
